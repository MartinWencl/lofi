- [ ] Remake keybinds
    - register all keybinds from lua with callbacks, in callbacks can generate events and modify state
    - create default lua scripts that contain the default keybinds (up/down, enter, ...)
        - create install target to move them into ~/.local/share/

FIXES:
    - [ ] fix cursor in textbox
    - [ ] continue scrolling when holding down up/down, now triggers only once
