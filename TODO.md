# TODO:
    - [ ] Create a core module, that sets all the common behaviour:
        - [ ] Kebinds - up/down/enter/etc

    - [ ] Use meson to install lofi. 
        - move the core module to ~/.local

## Cleanup:
    - [ ] lua and mode manager are kinda all over the place. Merge them into sensible units. Look at keymap store, separate mm into similar unit.
    - [ ] parsing the keybind string is awful

## Fixes:
    - [ ] fix cursor in textbox
